<!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Serenity -->
<!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an interactive dashboard centered around the user's primary goal: finding relevant affirmations. The structure prioritizes task-based navigation over mirroring the report's linear format. The core components are: 1) A primary category filter (Health, Money, etc.) for broad topic selection. 2) A secondary author filter to refine results. 3) A dynamic grid of affirmation cards that updates based on selections. 4) An interactive bar chart visualizing author contributions per category. 5) Collapsible sections for exploring author philosophies and practical integration techniques. This structure was chosen because it empowers the user to actively explore and cross-reference information, making the content more accessible, engaging, and personalized than a static document. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Affirmations: Report Info -> Lists of affirmations per category/author. Goal -> Allow users to easily find and focus on specific affirmations. Viz/Method -> A filterable grid of interactive cards (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction -> Users click category/author buttons to dynamically filter the grid. Justification -> Far more engaging and user-friendly than static lists. 2) Author Contributions: Report Info -> Implicit data on how many affirmations each author provides per category. Goal -> Provide a quick, comparative overview of the source material. Viz/Method -> Dynamic Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction -> Chart updates automatically when a primary category is selected. Justification -> Adds a quantitative, visual dimension to the qualitative data, enhancing understanding. 3) Author Philosophies: Report Info -> Detailed text blocks on author principles. Goal -> Make dense information digestible. Viz/Method -> Collapsible content sections (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Interaction -> User clicks to expand/collapse details. Justification -> Prevents information overload and keeps the interface clean. -->
